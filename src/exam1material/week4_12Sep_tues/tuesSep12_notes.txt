HW 3 due tonight

    Reminder: correct submission format

    repo/tree/digital fingerprint

    starting on HW 3, there will be a 5 pt deduction for
    submissions in the wrong format


Exam 1 is Thursday, September 14
    will review during second part of class

////////////////////////////////

Today:

- Correction of example from last week
- Reminder: order of operations
- Deduction rules with implies operator
- Exam 1 review

////////////////////////////////

Correction from example.


Consider this if-statement:

if (grade >= 80 || extraCredit == true) {
    if (grade <= 90 || extraCredit == true) {
        //do stuff
    }
}


p: grade >= 80
q: extraCredit == true
r: grade <= 90

(p V q) ^ (r V q)

In class we said this was equivalent to:
    p V (q ^ r)


Which was NOT correct. What is the correct translation?
    q V (p ^ r)



--> what is an equivalent, simpler if-statement?

    if (extraCredit == true || (grade <= 90 && grade >= 80)) {

    }



///////////////////////////////

Order of operations reminder.


p ∧ q ∨ r is equivalent to... ?

p, q, r ⊢ p ∧ q ∨ r
{
    1. p            premise
    2. q            premise
    3. r            premise

    //what now?
}

(p V q) V r |- ...
{
    1. premise
    2. {
        3. p V q               assume
    }
}


///////////////////////////////

Implies-elimination, →e

      P, P → Q
→e: -----------
        Q


Example:

//Suppose we know x > 5. What can we conclude?

if (x > 5) {
    y = 17;
}

///////////////////////////////

Syntax for using →e:

a. P                (some justification)
b. P → Q            (some justification)
c. Q                →e b a



////////////////////////////////////////

Implies-introduction, →i

      {P assume
      ... Q}
→i: -----------
      P → Q


Idea: if Q is true whenever P is, then we can promise that
    if P is true, then Q is too.

This is the relationship P → Q.


--> how does this relate to proofs with truth tables?





////////////////////////////////////////

Syntax for using →i:

a. {
    b. P            assume
    ...
    c. Q            (some justification)
}
d. P → Q            →i a




///////////////////////////////////////

Example (implies3.logika):

p → r,  q → r  ⊢  (p ∧ q) → r





////////////////////////////////////////

Example (implies4.logika):

--> What if we wanted to conclude (p ∨ q) → r

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point:

- Basic logical reasoning (over English statements and if-statements)
- Logic puzzles
- Circuits
- Truth tables
- Parse trees
- Proving two propositional logic statements are equivalent
    how?
    either truth tables (one for each, same set of truth assignments
        make both true)
    two natural deduction proofs (one as premise, one as conclusion
        - both ways)

- Prove propositional logic statements are NOT equivalent
    how?

    just need one truth assignment where the two statements
    have different outputs

- DeMorgan's laws on propositional logic (and their application)
    (like the HW)

- Satisfiability: whether there is at least one truth assignment
    that makes the statement true

    how prove satisfiable?
        just need one truth assignment that makes statement true

    how prove not satisfiable?
        need full truth table, show all truth assignments
        make statement false (i.e., contradictory)

- Translating between English and propositional logic

- Arguments (premises and a proposed conclusion)


- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    how prove valid?
        need to show that EVERY time the premises are all true
        then the conclusion is also true

    how prove invalid?
        need to find ONE time that the premises are all true
        but the conclusion is false

- Proving an argument with truth tables
    truth table for every premise and for the conclusion
    find the set of truth assignments that made EVERY premise true
        make sure that those truth assignments made the conclusion true

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic using the
    AND, OR, and IMPLIES rules


Closed notes/computers.

All problems will be "open-ended" - similar in content/format
to HW problems.

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation -- read carefully!
