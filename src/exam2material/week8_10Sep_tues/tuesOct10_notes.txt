- HW 4, problem 7
- Exam review

///////////////////////////////////////

Finish both directions of DeMorgan's first law

∀ x ¬P(x)       equivalent to       ¬(∃ x P(x))

(demorgan1.logika)

///////////////////////////////////////

Prove DeMorgan's second law

∃ x ¬P(x)       equivalent to       ¬(∀ x P(x))

Exam 2:
- Thursday, October 12 9:30-10:45 DUE 1109
- Closed notes, closed computers
- All "open-ended" problems - similar to HW 4-6

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic, esp. with negation rules
    - not elimination, not introduction, bottom elimination, and pbc
    - still expected to be familiar with all other rules

Sets, including:
    - set builder notation
    - N (natural, all positive), Z (integers), R (reals)
    - union, intersection, difference, subsets
    - general reasoning about sets

Predicate logic statements, including:
    - quantifiers
    - interpreting predicate logic statements in English
    - translating English statements to predicate logic
    - evaluating predicate logic statements in a domain
    - working with predicate logic statements involving sets of numbers
    - DeMorgan's laws
    - negating predicate logic statements

- Natural deduction proofs in predicate logic (deduction rules with quantifiers)

T- Using natural deduction to prove two statements are equivalent
