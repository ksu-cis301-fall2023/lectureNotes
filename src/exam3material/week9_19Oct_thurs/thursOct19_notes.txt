Today:

- finish predicate logic
- mathematical induction

Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.

///////////////////////////////////

Same argument might be VALID in one domain and INVALID in another

- deduction can only prove arguments that are valid in ANY domain
- we can't prove all valid arguments


Domain with integers with operations like +


All integers? 2 + 3 = ?


Subset (0,1,2,3,4) of integers. 2 + 3 = ?



////////////////////////////////////


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be true statements
that cannot be proved.

(depends on interpretations)


//////////////////////////////////

Mathematical induction.

Tool for proving something involving natural numbers

Base case: prove the statement is true for the first element in
    our domain.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some n in our domain.
    Given that, prove the statement is true for n+1.

--> how will this prove the statement for our entire domain?


**we will do something similar when proving the correctness of loops*



/////////////////////////////////

Example:

Let P(n) be the claim that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2


LHS(n) = ?
RHS(n) = ?


So to show P(n) holds, we can show that... ?



Try it out first.

n = 1?

LHS(1): ?
RHS(1): ?



n = 2?

LHS(2): ?
RHS(2): ?



n = 3?

LHS(3):
RHS(3):



Proof by induction.


Base case:

Inductive step:





/////////////////////////////////

Do you think induction can be used to prove properties for ALL integers?




/////////////////////////////////

Example: Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2.


Let P(n) be the claim that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2nâˆ’1) = n^2.

LHS(n)
RHS(n)

How can we show that P(n) holds for some positive integer n?





Try it out first.

n = 1?
n = 2?
n = 3?



Proof by induction.

Base case:



Inductive step. Assume ... We must show that ...




/////////////////////////////////

Example: 3^n - 1 is even.

Let P(n) be the claim that 3^n - 1 is even for all natural numbers n.




Try it out first.

n = 1?

n = 2?

n = 3?





Proof by induction.

Base case:

Inductive step. Assume ... We must show that ...


/////////////////////////////////

Template for mathematical induction:

1) Express the claim to be proved, like this:

"Let P(n) be the claim that ... for all n (describe the domain of n)".

If the claim is an equality, write out LHS(n) and RHS(n) for P(n).



2) Write "Base case". Show that P(k) is true for the smallest value of k.
    Write "The base case holds".


3) Write "Inductive step". State the inductive hypothesis:
    "Assume P(n) is true for some arbitrary n (describe the domain of n).
    (Write what P(n) means.) We must prove that P(n+1) also holds --
        that is, that" (write what P(n+1) means).

    Use the information from P(n) to prove P(n+1).

    Write "The inductive step holds."


/////////////////////////////////

Errors in mathematical induction.

P(n): all horses in a set of n horses are the same color
    (where n is at least 1)


Base case: We must show that P(1) holds. Clearly, all horses in
a set of 1 horse have the same color. The base case holds.


Inductive step: Assume the inductive hypothesis -- that P(n) holds,
which means that all horses in a set of n horses have the same color.
We must prove that P(n+1) holds -- that all horses in a
set of n+1 horses have the same color.

We number our n+1 horses: 1, 2, 3, ..., n, n+1.

By the inductive hypothesis, the horses in the set (1, 2, ..., n)
have the same color and the horses in the set (2, 3, ..., n, n+1)
have the same color (since both sets are size n).

The two sets overlap, so all n+1 horses have the same color.

Thus the inductive step holds.

///////////////////////////////////

How about this one?

Let P(n) be the claim: for every positive integer n, if x and y are
positive integers and max(x,y) = n, then x = y.


Base case: We must show that P(1) holds -- that if x and y are
positive integers and max(x, y) = 1, then x = y. Clearly x = y = 1,
so the base case holds.


Inductive step: Assume the inductive hypothesis -- that P(n) holds for
a positive integer n, which means that if x and y are positive integers
and max(x,y) = n, then x = y.

We must show that P(n+1) holds -- that if x and y are positive integers
and max(x,y) = n+1, then x = y.

Suppose max(x,y) = n+1 and that x and y are positive integers. Then
max(x-1,y-1) = n, and so by the inductive hypothesis, x-1 = y-1.
It follows that x = y, so the inductive step holds.

Next time:
- recursive definitions
- begin a survey of proof techniques (direct proof, conditional proof,
    contrapositive proof, proof by contradiction)
