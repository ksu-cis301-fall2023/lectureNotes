Exam 2 discussion.

High: 100/100
Average: 79/100

A (90-100): 39 students! (I've never had that many A's on an exam)
B (80-89): 13 students
C (70-79): 9 students
D/F (69 and below): 22 students

Briefly discuss exam.

Exam grades in Canvas
- drops lowest among Exam 1, Exam 2, Exam 3,
    *midterm equivalent from final*

- what does this mean with the final exam?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

HW 7 will be posted after class, due Tues Oct 24

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Today:

- predicate logic proofs with nested quantifiers
- soundness and completeness in predicate logic
- begin mathematical induction

/////////////////////////////////

Proofs with nested quantifiers.

- approach exactly the same as proofs with single quantifiers
...but, can only plug in for / introduce a single quantifier at once


Examples:

//nested1.logika
∀ x (∀ y P(x, y)) ⊢ ∀ y (∀ x P(x, y))

//nested2.logika
∃ x (∃ y P(x, y)) ⊢ ∃ y (∃ x P(x, y))

//nested3.logika
∀ x (∀ y (C(x) → D(y))), ∃ x C(x) ⊢ ∀ y D(y)

//nested4.logika
∃ y (∀ x P(x, y)) ⊢ ∀ x (∃ y P(x, y))

    --> can we prove the opposite?

//////////////////////////////

Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.


Soundness: definition?

    propositional:

    predicate logic:




Completeness: definition?

    propositional:

    predicate logic:



///////////////////////////////////

Same argument might be VALID in one domain and INVALID in another

- deduction can only prove arguments that are valid in ANY domain
- we can't prove all valid arguments


Domain with integers with operations like +


All integers? 2 + 3 = ?


Subset (0,1,2,3,4) of integers. 2 + 3 = ?



////////////////////////////////////


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be true statements
that cannot be proved.

(depends on interpretations)


//////////////////////////////////

Mathematical induction.

Tool for proving something involving natural numbers

Base case: prove the statement is true for the first element in
    our domain.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some n in our domain.
    Given that, prove the statement is true for n+1.

--> how will this prove the statement for our entire domain?


**we will do something similar when proving the correctness of loops*



/////////////////////////////////

Example:

Let P(n) be the claim that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2


LHS(n) = ?
RHS(n) = ?


So to show P(n) holds, we can show that... ?



Try it out first.

n = 1?

LHS(1): ?
RHS(1): ?



n = 2?

LHS(2): ?
RHS(2): ?



n = 3?

LHS(3):
RHS(3):



Proof by induction.


Base case:

Inductive step:





/////////////////////////////////

Do you think induction can be used to prove properties for ALL integers?




/////////////////////////////////

Example: Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2.


Let P(n) be the claim that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n−1) = n^2.

LHS(n)
RHS(n)

How can we show that P(n) holds for some positive integer n?





Try it out first.

n = 1?
n = 2?
n = 3?



Proof by induction.

Base case:



Inductive step. Assume ... We must show that ...




/////////////////////////////////

Example: 3^n - 1 is even.

Let P(n) be the claim that 3^n - 1 is even for all natural numbers n.




Try it out first.

n = 1?

n = 2?

n = 3?





Proof by induction.

Base case:

Inductive step. Assume ... We must show that ...

Next time:
- more with mathematical induction
- begin a survey of proof techniques (direct proof, conditional proof,
    contrapositive proof, proof by contradiction)
