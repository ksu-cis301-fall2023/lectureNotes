Use truth tables to prove that the following argument is valid.

Premises: p → q, q → ¬r
Conclusion: p → ¬r

Explain from your results why we know the argument is valid.

p q r | p → q    |   q → ¬r      |  p → ¬r
------------------------------------------
T T T |   T            F F            F F
T T F |   T            T T            T T
T F T |   F            T F            F F
T F F |   F            T T            T T
F T T |   T            F F            T F
F T F |   T            T T            T T
F F T |   T            T F            T F
F F F |   T            T T            T T

Makes premises both true: [T T F] [F T F] [F F T] [F F F]
The conclusion is also true for those truth assignments so the argument is
valid.

To show invalid, find ONE truth assignment that makes all premises true
but conclusion false.

(How do we show an argument is *invalid*?)
