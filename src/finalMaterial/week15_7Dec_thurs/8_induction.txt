Use mathematical induction to prove that the following expression:
    n(n+1)(n+5)
Is a multiple of 3 for all integers n>=1.

Let P(n) be the claim that n(n+1)(n+5) is a multiple of 3
    for all integer n >= 1.



Base case. We must show that P(n) holds for the smallest n, where n = 1.
We have that 1(1+1)(1+5) = 1*2*6 = 12, which is a multiple of 3.
The base case holds.



Inductive step. Assume the inductive hypothesis -- that P(k) holds
for some fixed integer k >= 1. We must show that P(k+1) also holds, i.e.,
we must prove that (k+1)((k+1)+1)((k+1)+5) is a multiple of 3.

We have that:
    (k+1)((k+1)+1)((k+1)+5) = (k+1)(k+2)(k+6).

If P(k) holds, we know that k(k+1)(k+5) is divisible by 3.
Since 3 is a prime number, this tells us that at least one of
k, k+1, or k+5 is a multiple of 3. We consider each case:

    Suppose k is a multiple of 3. Then k+6 is also multiple of 3, and so
    (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3.

    Suppose k+1 is a multiple of 3. Then (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is also
    a multiple of 3.

    Suppose k+5 is a multiple of 3. Then k+2 is also a multiple of 3,
    and so (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3.

In all cases, (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) is a multiple of 3, so we have shown
 P(k+1). The inductive step holds.


Thus P(n) holds for all natural numbers n.
